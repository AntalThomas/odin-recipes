The Odin Project: Recipe Website Project

I am creating a recipe website for my first project on The Odin Project course. I will only be using
HTML to complete this project no incorporation of CSS, Javascript, etc.

I found recipes from "https://www.allrecipes.com/" used the information and found appropriate pictures
to go onto my website page, added a return to homepage link and a link to the original website recipe.

Learnt briefly after messing around how git works and what "-A" and "-m" do when you commit.
